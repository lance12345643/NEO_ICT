<h1 style="text-align:center; color:#C19A6B;">REFLECTION</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#C19A6B;">As I step into the world of coding when I was grade 8, I was scared on how coding is very complicated and how I will fail ICT. But one thing I realized was never giving up will lead to success. Now in grade 9 ICT, I feel like I am not doing my best since I never really found the will to code, but reflecting now while doing my portfolio made me think otherwise. I think these HTML lessons will be manifested into my hobbies as I am fond on designing my webpages while I incorporate my thoughts. It gave me a sense of home, responsibility and comfort. I also reflected that Coding is not hard, you just need to understand and persevere and NEVER cram.</h3>

<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#C19A6B;">REFLECTION</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#C19A6B;">As I step within the field of the 2nd quarter, I was determined to prove to everybody that I will become better. Eventhough it may not seem like it, I believe I evolved to a different person. Not physically nor spiritually but mentally as I became stronger and endured many hardships within my time today. This E-Portfolio is a symbol on how I can achieved greater heights by setting my mind into something. I may look weak they say but this person is also a tough cookie,learning how to communicate and lead communities for the greater good. Eventhought the start of my grade 9 journey was bitter, I flipped it into a sweet confectionary as I can do it. I also learned to lessen cramming as it is harmful and only adds up stress within me. Now as I enter this 3rd Quarter, I know that by believing in myself I can achieve the goals I have setted upon me. Being an "honor" is just a title, but being a "kind" person is a lifestyle. I would also like to extend my gratitude to my Mentor within this ICT journey, Ms.Uminga for always being so considerate in our journey. Without her, Our Grade 9 experience would be simply dark. </h3>

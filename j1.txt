<p><font class="Typo">
Old MacDonald had a farm
<br>E-I-E-I-O
<br>And on his farm he had a cow
<br>E-I-E-I-O
<br>With a moo-moo here
<br>And a moo-moo there
<br>Here a moo, there a moo
<br>Everywhere a moo-moo
<br>Old MacDonald had a farm
<br>E-I-E-I-O

<h1>The Grand Old Duke of York</h1>
<p>
<br>Oh, the grand old Duke of York,
<br>He had ten thousand men,
<br>He marched them up to the top of the hill,
<br>And he marched them down again
<br><br>
<br>And when they were up they were up.
<br>And when they were down they were down
<br>And when they were only halfway up,
<br>They were neither up nor down
</p>
<h1>Jack and Jill</h1>
<p class="bottomcolor"><br>Jack and Jill went up the hill,
<br>To fetch a pail of water.
<br>Jack fell down and broke his crown,
<br>And Jill came tumbling after</p>
